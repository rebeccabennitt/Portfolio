	**Summary
Bon Forage is a mobile application which would allow consumers to locate Farmers' Markets near them as well as specific vendors, along with the ability to source, reserve and pay for local products by incorporating a mobile payment solution.
**Explanation
I designed this app in order to provide the best experience for users and vendors to locate markets and specific goods, create opportunities for more sales and better inventory control for vendors as well as streamlining the transactions between vendors and consumers. My goal was to understand more about the different personalities who attend farmers markets as well as create a tool that will enhance the experience.

**Problem
Consumers:
* Easily locate farmers markets, vendors, local goods on specific days times
* Need streamlined payment options
Vendors:
* Issues with knowing what products and quantity to provide

**Solution



The consumer will be able to view items available (including quantity) and purchase these items for pick-up. The app would allow customers to reserve/purchase specific items off-site, helping them to avoid missing out on those limited, high-demand items. Returning users can view their previous transactions, create lists of favorite markets, vendors and items (with notifications when their favorites are available/unavailable, etc.) as well as communicate directly with vendors about their orders. The consumer would have the ability to read and provide public reviews for the market, the vendors and the items they've purchased from much like Yelp. The app would also include a live "social" feed with check-ins and latest reviews. There would also be an area for direct conversations between all users: vendor-consumer, vendor-vendor, consumer-consumer.

In turn, the vendor would have the opportunity to create a virtual storefront and advertise their product offerings, their locations by day and time as well as have a more accurate idea of the inventory they should have in stock at the market that day, based on their pre-paid reserved goods. The vendor would also be able to send notifications when they will be available/unavailable or specific items will be available/unavailable.
