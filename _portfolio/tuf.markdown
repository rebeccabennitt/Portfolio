## The University Florist


## Ideas/Approach
1. building a virtual cooler -- focus on special nature of live product, care
2. cleaner interface â€” Flower shopsites tend to be "busy"
3. maintains the boutique styling, customer-centric selling

Do a simple google search -- there's nothing clean or attractive about online floral retail. It simply doesn't exist.

You'll notice none of these are selling flowers...meaning nobody's really doing anything groundbreaking in retail floral -- why is that? is the industry exempt from needing to be online? that's hard for me to believe.

## Research/Competitive Analysis

Mass Floral Retailers: 

* proflowers.com
* teleflora.com
* 1800flowers.com
* thebouqs.com
* justflowers.com
* avasflowers.com

For the most partm the seletcion and look is awful. although teleflora has cleaned up its look as of late --the website look/ pages-- the arrangements are still awful. It also has that QUICK SHOP tool which is neat for a customer. (filters results on what's the occasion, the person receiving, how much do you want to spend.) that's the type of feature I'd want to build off of.

existing brick and mortar space -- in other words, this could be a preliminary university florist site. Advantages here: it certainly would make it easier to start with something that has some historical data, content/logos/images that I can readily plug in or refactor -- rather than recreating the wheel and building all the parts.  It would give me an actual "client" rather than me making up one or be the designer designing for myself (That's not exactly how it would work in the real world -- one of the first rules we talked about in my work  was FIRST you design to solve a problem/create a solution. you often do not design to please yourself -- you aren't the user.) Disadvantages: don't get into any issues with your admin; might be limiting, stay within branding guidelines of University

 The site and how it works -- shows products, reviews, how you check out, would be essentially the same. I'd wireframe it, design pages, color palettes, typography etc. the same way -- products might include: Flowers, virtual cooler, plants, decor, gift, plug in some social media. TUF site could still be conceptual -- what an ideal UF site would be -- but it would be something you could eventually use when you get ready to change out your existing site.
